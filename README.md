# Maintainer needed
I do not use sublime anymore and therefore can't properly maintain the package. If you feel, that you need it and can improve - please contact me about transferring this package.

This package is a temorary hack, however it seems like it still needed by some people.

All Autocomplete Sublime Text
===========================================================

Extends the default autocomplete to find matches in all open files.

By default Sublime only considers words found in the current file.

This is a fork of https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete/

This fork includes hack to fix SASS and CSS dash bug
